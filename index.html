<h1>Giant Panda
</h1>

<p>Giant pandas give birth to twins in about half of pregnancies. JA HÄR OCKSÅ
</p> 

<p>If twins are born, usually only one survives in the wild. The mother will select the stronger of the cubs, and the weaker cub will die due to starvation.
</p>
    
<p> mother is thought to be unable to produce enough milk for two cubs since she does not store fat. The father has no part in helping raise the cub.

<h3>Which baby will live? which will die?</h3>
